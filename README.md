# Matlab-TimeseriesAnalysis
Code for time series data analysis: data are event data with durations in minutes, called red and green events.
Data are provided as .xlsx with col1: dates, col2; red events, and col3: green events.

## Data Exploration:
- Number of red and green events
- Mean and maximum values of red and green events
- Plot red and green events
- Examination of season subtests (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) > plot their mean values
- Examination of April subtest > plot red and green values

## Data Processing:
- Examination of how to fill in missing data (inpaint_nans vs interp1 examined) > plot values
- Examination of filters to smoothen data > plot (split red and green to examine filter impacts)

## Modelling Future Values:
Outstanding: examine which model would be the most appropriate and then apply it to data to study 2022 data
